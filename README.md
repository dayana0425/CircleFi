__Project Description__

The informal economy employs about 2 billion women and men and employs 60% of the global workforce. The informal economy exists in all countries, regardless of socioeconomic development level, but statistics show that it is more prevalent in developing countries, with percentages ranging from 67% to 90% ([International Labour Office](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_626831.pdf)).
