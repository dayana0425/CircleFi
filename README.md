__Project Description__

The informal economy employs about 2 billion women and men and employs 60% of the global workforce. The informal economy exists in all countries, regardless of socioeconomic development level, but statistics show that it is more prevalent in developing countries, with percentages ranging from 67% to 90% ([International Labour Office](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_626831.pdf)).

Considering the high statistics of individuals working globally in the informal economy, there is an urgent need for financial services to help combat this informality in order to promote financial inclusion and enable wealth building.

With CircleFi, we believe we can empower the 2 billion individuals currently working in the informal economy to save, build wealth and achieve their goals together.
